        <h1> About </h1>
        <h2> Me </h2>
        <p>
            My name is Nicholas Gregg, I was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas. I hold two Bachleors of Science, one in Chemical Engineering and on in Electrical Engineering, both from Texas Tech University. As a kid I held endless curiosity about everything, whether that was math and science, or arts and crafts, nothing was beyond the scope of my curiosity. As an adult I came to understand without infinite time there's only so much I can learn about so I focused on math and science. I've been particularly interested in the complexity of Embedded Systems, I've found I can spend hours learning about different subdisciplines. If it weren't for my other obligations and competing interests I'd probably never take a break.

        <h2> My Hobbies </h2>
        <p>
            While I'm not learning I try to maintain a active and challenging lifestyle. I actively track a few different health metrics, like weight, calorie intake, and sleep, to ensure I'm improving in regards to my physical fitness. I'm fond of camping and whenever I get the chance I participate in solo bikepacking trips on trails in different parts of Texas.
